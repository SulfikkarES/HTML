<p>A basic page need onliy a bare minimum of programming.Graphics are an important part of Web pages but so too are words.I look upon the Web as a medium for ideas and the use of new tecnologies,but not the other

<hr>

<p> To begin,we can change the</p>

<h2>header size</h2>



and <span style="color:blue;"> color </span> <span style="color:red;">of</span> <span style="color:Green;">letters </span>seen on the screen.The <span style="font-size:35px;">font size</span> can be changed as well,and actually gives more choices.<br><br>

We can also change the appearance of word on the screen. This shows some differing word type in blocked quote. <br><br>

  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <font face="Arial" size="2px" >Now is the <i>time </i>for all good <b>people</b> to <b>come</b> to the <i>aid</i> of their country.</font><br><br>
  
That was also an example of a nested command
